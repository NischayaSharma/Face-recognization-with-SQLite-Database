# Face-recognization-with-SQLite-Database
Face recognization using Open cv python with SQLite Database<br>

Hey whats up guys ;) I know that you are very exited for deep learning :D <br>
Details about Face recognization and SQLite Database <br>

Thanks to OpenCV, coding facial recognition is now easier than ever. There are three easy steps to computer coding facial recognition, which are similar to the steps that our brains use for recognizing faces.<br> These steps are:

01:Data Gathering: Gather face data (face images in this case) of the persons you want to identify.<br>
02:Train the Recognizer: Feed that face data and respective names of each face to the recognizer so that it can learn.<br>
03:Recognition: Feed new faces of that people and see if the face recognizer you just trained recognizes them.<br>
<h2>Requirements: </h2>
1. Python 3.7 <br>
2. Sqlite <br>
3. OpenCV2 <br>
4. Haarcascade file(usually comes with openCV) <br>

<h2>Follow this step now: </h2>
1. To check if all the dependencies are installed and the project will run, run `IntroPy.py` <br>
2. If `IntroPy.py` runs, then create the data set by running datasetCreator.py<br>
3. Now to train the recognizer run `trainner.py` <br>
4. After training the code, its time to test it out so run `detector.py`<br>
